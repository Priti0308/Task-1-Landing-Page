            <h2>Our event(ful) history</h2>

            <p>
            <P>It all began with a party. While pledging a national fraternity at the University of Iowa, young Donald
                S. “Buck” Freeman discovered his passion for party decorating and parades. Buck saw an opportunity to
                use his enthusiasm for bringing people together to create meaningful experiences.
            </P>
            <p> A true visionary, Buck firmly believed in creating personal relationships in an impersonal world. As
                Freeman grew from a humble decorating company to servicing trade shows, conferences, and events across
                the country, Buck’s commitment to building these meaningful customer relationships became infused
                throughout the organization.
            </p>
            <p> Our never-ending drive to meet customers’ ever-changing needs — and to do it better than anyone else —
                has grown Freeman to one of the world’s leading event companies.
            </p>


            </p>

            </p>
            <br> <br> <br> <br>
            <h1>Making moments that matter.
                From the beginning.</h1>
            <p>Almost a century after Buck threw his first college party, the customers and venues have changed,
                technology has evolved, our reach is far greater, and the event services we offer far more expansive.
                Yet even as Freeman continues to grow, our commitment to making moments that matter remains the same.
            </p>
